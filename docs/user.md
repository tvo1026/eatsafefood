# User Manual - Eat Safe Foods

Eat Safe Foods is an application which empowers users to quickly generate a report on the health related history of any food serving establishment in Prince George’s County. Using a simple search and click interface will cause a report to be generated on any selected establishment. This report provides users with an overview of previous inspections and notifies the user of the results of the most recent inspection. 

## Report Feature
Eat Safe Foods also allows users to report any establishments they may have visited prior to contracting Covid-19. This information can be used to determine which restaurants may have been exposed to Covid-19, and that information is then added to Eat Safe Foods’s report page.

## Navigate Report Function
To access the report function, first navigate to the restaurant search either in the navigation bar at the top of the page or by clicking the “Restaurant Safety Search” link in the “Essential Features” section of the home page. As the user enters either the name or address into the search bar, a list of matching restaurants will be generated. Clicking the name of the relevant restaurant will present the user with the report page.

To use the Covid-19 report feature, either click “Form” in the navigation bar or “Covid-19 Report Form” in the “Essential Features” section of the home page. From here the user can click “Add” in order to report a restaurant. The correct address must be entered to link to the relevant restaurant.
